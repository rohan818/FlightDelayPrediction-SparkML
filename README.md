# Flight Delay Prediction Notebook

## Overview
This Jupyter notebook is dedicated to predicting flight delays using Apache Spark (`PySpark`). It showcases the end-to-end process of handling flight data, from preprocessing to model evaluation. Dataset used is publicly available. It utilizes cross-validation for training models and assesses their performance on a test set to ensure reliability in delay predictions.

## Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following Python libraries installed:
- findspark
- numpy
- pandas
- pyspark

## Usage
Follow the notebook cells sequentially to replicate the flight delay prediction process.
